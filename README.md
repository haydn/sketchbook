## Installation

Sketchbook is still under development and hasn't been published yet. Below is a
draft on the setup instructions that should work once everything is in place.

> Sketchbook.js requires Node 10 or newer and a modern browser.
>
> 1.  `yarn add sketchbook-js`
> 2.  `yarn sketchbook init` (generates a `./sketchbook/config.js` file)
> 3.  `yarn sketchbook start` (uses the `./sketchbook/config.js` file)
